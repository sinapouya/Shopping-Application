Shopping Application.
this project is a backend of a shop that functionalities listed here :
Functionality:
1. User sign-in signup. The application should have 2 types of roles, ADMIN, and USER.
2. Admin functionality -> CRUD of products per category, block unblock the users.
3. Users should be able to search for products per product name, price range, rate, etc.I use jpaspecification for this functionality.
4. Users should be able to rate the product(1-5), leave a comment on it.
4. I use  MySQL as RDBMS. Usage of Spring Data + JPA + Hibernate is preferable.
5. there is no UI and only web service and there is postman collection for all possible requests .
7. the application is deployed on https://technicaltask.herokuapp.com 
I use Spring Boot's last stable version for this application.
